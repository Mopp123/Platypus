Bind pose is a part of mesh.
What about animation data?
    -> multiple meshes can use same animation data
        -> animation asset
            BUT
            animation asset ends up being just an extra variable with the animation data struct
                -> dumb as hell
                    -> necessary evil?


What animating requires:
    *bind pose (asset)
    *animation data (asset)
    *animation state (instance)
    *joint to animate (instance)
    *target transform (instance)


ISSUES:
    Naming conventions for Anim asset and component
    Want to provide only raw data through gltf loader
        -> messy as fuck
