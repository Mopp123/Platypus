Material descriptor set updating, depending on external resource (for example: Material::updateShadowmapDescriptorSet)
is getting pretty annoying if making similar system for transparent stuff...

    *shadowmap descriptor index is "regular texture indices" + 1
        -> u could make this a rule where the depth is all above +1?
            -> ISSUE: This just makes the Material even more convoluted mess!
