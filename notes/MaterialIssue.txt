LOOK AT (especially shaders): https://vkguide.dev/docs/new_chapter_4/materials/
    -> some fat scene data descriptor set, containing also view and proj matrices


*Some renderes use Material assets, some not

*Material is considered essentially "the shader"
    -> Shader requires a few more inputs in addition to the material tho
        -> but is it really an issue?

----

Material:
    *Description how a surface should look like, EXCLUDING everything else!
        -> work that in mind, it's just that simple

Pipeline:
    *The whole shit how stuff gets drawn... -> atm see google drive notes
