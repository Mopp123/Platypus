Maybe take a look how Godot does it

What does rendering require (secondary cmd buf level, where actually calling render commands)
    *Mesh data
    *Component data
    *Misc. data
        -additional vertex buffers (for example: instancing)
        -additional uniform buffers + descriptors (for example: skeletal animation)

Same as above but lower level:
    *pipeline
    *vertex buffers
    *index buffers
    *descriptor sets
    *push constants

    ...its that simple
        -> BUT how to render multiple instances?
        *"dumb rendering"
        *instanced rendering

    Dumb rendering
        *Descriptor sets needs to live somewhere (for example: joint uniform buffer)
            -> could be a part of Material
            BUT that "ruins" the idea of Material being just a material


Issue:
*Each renderer works so differently
    -> theres no reason to try forcing them work the same way?
