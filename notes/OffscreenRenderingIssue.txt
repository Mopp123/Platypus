Offscreen rendering requires separate Pipeline, because Pipeline depends on RenderPass.
    Theres 2 possible approaches
        1. Submit entity's components into a separate offscreen batch
            + It would be easy to manage which entities cast shadows and which dont!!
            - Batch creation and submitting becomes heavier!
            BUT: Keeping in mind view frustum culling!
        2. While submitting, check components' status's and create the offscreen pipeline
        for the batch, if necessary
            -> Renderer3D has func to handle the secondary command buffers for batches
            containing the offscreen Pipeline

        Common problem with both of these: Where should the offscreen pipeline live?
        Currently the Pipeline is inside the Material. Would it make sense to actually
        have all the Pipelines live inside the Batcher? -> would make the Material more light?


        Just need to have some quick way to test this shit, no matter how bad its performance wise!!!
            -> Make Terrain rendering batch also create an offscreen pipeline for the batch?
                -> Add offscreen recordCommandBuffers func for Renderer3D which just uses the batch's offscreen pipeline?
