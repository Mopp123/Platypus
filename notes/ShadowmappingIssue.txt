ISSUE: Some shader resources are shared between offscreen and onscreen render passes.

    EXAMPLE:
        Static shadowpass uses:
            *mesh vertex buffer
            *instanced vertex buffer

            *common 3D scene descriptor set (for now)

        Static shadowpass DOESN'T use:
            *material descriptor set

            -> HOW TO SHARE DESCRIPTOR SETS OF SEPARATE BATCHES?
                -> some kind of "main batch" that may have "shadowpass batches" if necessary?
                    OR
                    -> group batch's stuff into separate "render pass" stuff?


NOTE: Current Batch struct should encapsulate everything needed for a single render pass (as it should...)
    -> should this be actually called something else? The actual batch something else?

---
Unique batch creation properties:
    *mesh vertex buffers
    *mesh index buffers
    *mesh vertex buffer layout
    *(issue with terrain mesh, maybe it should rather be regular mesh and have uvs in its vertex buffer data, instead of figuring it out in the shaders -> BUT how would you deal with the tiling tex coords which needs to be a variable)
    *pipeline creation args
    *"unique batch buffer" creation description (shader resources, assuming that Material already has its shader resources figured out)
    *descriptor set combination "description" (in order to get necessary descriptor sets into a single container, in order to know at cmd buf record time all descriptor sets in order to use)
