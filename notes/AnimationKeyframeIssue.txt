How the fuck there's 12 for 4 keyframes per node?!?!?!
    -> Theres no discrepancy if "sampling animations"(packed full between keyframes)

How anim channel "components"(translations, rotations) are supposed to be associated with
the same accessor's keyframes?

Current system fucked, since node's missing data is per translation and rotation channels!
    -> the add_missing func doesn't work

In other words:
    Node has certain set of translation channels AND rotation channels.
    There may be more translation channels than rotation channels per node!
        -> Need to figure out how to add the missing ones, INDEPENDENTLY from one another!
