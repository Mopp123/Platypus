Batch creation:

1. validate batch doesnt exist already for targeted render pass
2. get pipeline from material (if uses material, otherwise create the pipeline)
3. if receives shadows -> get shadow proj and view matrices as push constants from pDirLight
4. get or create per batch dynamic vertex buffers (optional)
    *requiers knowing the dynamic vertex buffer's element size
    *requires knowing the batch's "shared batch resource's" indices if the resource was already created
        -> requires some kind of batch creation layout for each different kind of batch to know this, which also helps a lot in few other things!
5. get used mesh's vertex and index buffers
6. get or create per batch descriptor sets (optional)
    *requires knowing the ShaderResourceLayouts for the batch
    *requires knowing the "shared batch resources'" indices just like the dynamic vertex buffers at section 4.
7. combine used descriptor sets, where:
    Scene3DDataDescriptorSets are first.
    Batch specific descriptor sets in the middle.
    Material's descriptor sets last (if used by the batch at all).

Adding to batch:

1. put all inputted data into a single contiguous buffer
2. go through each batch found with the batch's ID
3. make sure the batch has enough space
    *this requires knowing is the batch using instance or repeat count or both?
        -> could be known using the batch layout thing mentioned earlier
4. go through each of the batch's shared resource indices
5. take the data in the contiguous input buffer (constructed at section 1) and update
    the shared batch buffer at appropriate offset with appropriate size.
6. mark the resource as updated (so batches sharing the same ID don't need to re update it) and
    advance to the next position in the input buffer and batch resource index.
    NOTE: This should be possible by knowing the batch layout thing!
